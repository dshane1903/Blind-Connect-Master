# blind-connect

This is the repoistory for blind-connect. You are required to be running Windows 10 and use a USB 3.0 cable to connect to Kinect 2. 
You must run "npm install" in the root folder to update modules after cloning. Navigation is our working folder. cd into it and then run "node index.js" to ensure that the Kinect 2 and Arduino are already connected. 
There should be a jumper wire on pin 10 that connects to the motor and another pin that connects to the ground. This allows the kinect to detect any object within a range of 50 centimeters.
